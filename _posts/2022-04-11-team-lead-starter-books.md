From time to time I get requests about what books to read for a novice team lead, engineering manager, PM, etc. - so I just decided to write a post on that matter :) 

This is an Evergreen post.

If you are a novice try to read first 1-3 books in each category before moving deeper.

# Software Development Methodologies

Most companies adopted agile in one way or another, so 95% chance that you will be dealing with either `Scrum` or `Kanban` (to be precise - with some variations of them as I don't think I ever saw 100% "from the book" implementation - there are always some modifications).

## Scrum

"Classic" agile methodology, I think it was THE most popular methodology(except places with no particular methodology at all) in the world at some point in time. 

1. [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/) by Henrik Kniberg - very good field manual on how to SCRUM
2. [Official Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100) by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland - RTFM :) Note: this guide gets eventual updates and changes over time to adopt current practices in the Scrum community, so it is always helpful to read the most recent version of the guide
3. Optional: [Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X) by Jeff Sutherland

## Kanban (Kanban Method, to be precise)

Not new, but trending methodology which I prefer nowadays as a default choice for new projects.

1. [The Official Guide To The Kanban Method](https://resources.kanban.university/kanban-guide/) by Kanban University - RTFM
2. [Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business](https://www.amazon.com/Kanban-David-J-Anderson-ebook/dp/B0057H2M70/) by David J. Anderson - the BLUE (it's actually RED in Russian translation - WTF?!) book of Kanban - must read
